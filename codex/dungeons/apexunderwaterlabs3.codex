"In taste test #398, the subject was unable to distinguish between the taste of real banana (for a value of real, anyway) and that of 'I can't believe it's not banana!' banana-flavoured substitute. In fact, when presented with evidence to the contrary, she flatly refused to believe it.",

"This marks a sounding success as the subject was a three-time winner of the cooking game show, 'Big Ape's Kitchen'. As of our latest formulation, less than 0.1% of subjects were able to discern the substitute.

Soon, it may be possible to replace up to 70% of bananas consumed by all Apex with 'I can't believe it's not banana!' coralcreep-derived paste, lowering costs and easing rationing procedures."
